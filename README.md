Here is some more information on my pinned projects below.

#### [credit-card-fraud](https://github.com/htlambley/credit-card-fraud) [Python, scikit-learn]
This is an independent project to learn the practicalities of data science and usage of scikit-learn, with references to the current literature on machine learning, developed in 
my free time. In it, I construct various classification models with high levels of efficiency and discuss cutting-edge methods which could be used in future research on the dataset. [View the project webpage](https://htlambley.github.io/credit-card-fraud/).

#### [matrix](https://github.com/htlambley/matrix) [C]
A simple library developed implementing fundamental matrix algorithms such as Gaussian elimination and various matrix decompositions. The emphasis is on implementing the standard algorithms correctly with a relatively straightforward library interface.
